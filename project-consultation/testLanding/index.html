    <main>
        <p>Starting your day with intention sets the tone for everything that follows. 
        A simple morning ritual — stretching, journaling, or enjoying a quiet cup of 
        coffee — can improve focus, motivation, and mood throughout the day.</p>

             <h2>Something New Every Day</h2> 

            <p>Continuous learning keeps the mind active and flexible. Whether it’s a new language, 
            skill, or idea, even five minutes of daily curiosity builds long-term growth and confidence.</p>

            <h2>The Value of Rest and Recovery</h2> 

            <p>Modern life glorifies productivity, but real progress happens when we rest. Sleep, quiet walks, and digital breaks are not laziness — they’re vital for creativity and balance.

        <h2>Connection Over Perfection</h2>

        <p>Perfection can isolate us; connection heals. Sharing your experiences honestly — even the 
        imperfect ones — creates genuine relationships and meaningful understanding.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>Living with Purpose</h2>

        <p>Purpose doesn’t always appear in big moments. It’s often found in small acts of kindness, 
        consistency, and alignment with what truly matters to you.</p>
